# Project Self Citation Detector

This project is aimed to build a self citation detector tool for the published research articles in google scholar.
Although, it is not directly using the google scholar dataset but download the content for a specific scholar and use the downloaded data for further processing and identifying the self citation.

The prototyped deployed service can be found at https://self-citation-detector.vercel.app/home
